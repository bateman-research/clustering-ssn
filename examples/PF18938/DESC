CC   This entry contains atypical Rib (aRib) domains.  These are found in
CC   a variety of bacterial cell surface proteins. These proteins share a
CC   conserved motif with the Rib domain (YPDXXD). The structure of the
CC   aRib domain has been solved from two proteins, the SrpA adhesin [1]
CC   and the GspB adhesin [2]. In these proteins this domain has been
CC   termed the unique domain due to its lack of similarity to any other
CC   known structures at the time. The aRib domain from SrpA has been
CC   shown to mediate a dimer interaction [1]. This family has been added
CC   to the E-set clan based on its similarity to the Rib domain, although
CC   it does not contain the Ig fold.
